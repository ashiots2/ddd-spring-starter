# layered-spring-starter
An empty spring project, using maven, which will be re-used to kick-start new projects without the overhead of creating the master project with all the submodules.

The layered architecture approach is beneficial as different parts of the application evolve at different rates and this will help control this.
Finish domain first!

When cloning this, don't forget to change:
 * artifact ID (in both parent and sub-modules),
 * name in parent module
 * description in parent module
 * groupId (if you are not me)
 
Dependencies are set to RELEASE to be up to date when imported.
